### 3. **Submitting a Purchase Request**  
- Buyers lock funds by submitting a request using smart contracts.  
- Transactions remain secure with funds held in escrow until completion.  

### 4. **Ownership Transfer**  
- Once the seller approves, the smart contract:  
  - Transfers ownership of the NFT to the buyer.
